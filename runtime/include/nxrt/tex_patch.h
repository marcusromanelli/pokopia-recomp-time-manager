// Texture rectangle patch: writes new pixels into a rectangle of one of the game's own BC7 textures (an icon in a UI atlas), in the game's
// storage, and has the texture uploaded again. Unlike tex_override.h (whole small textures, answered at upload) and tex_edit.h (ASTC textures
// re-encoded on the PC), the change is made once, by the caller, in the bytes the game reads; the caller keeps what was there to put it back.
